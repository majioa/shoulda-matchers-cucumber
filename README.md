The gem to be used to support the [shoulda matchers](https://github.com/thoughtbot/shoulda-matchers) and [rspec expectation](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-expectations) syntaxes in the cucumber step methods, without picking up the whole rspec, or specifying the shoulda matchers.

### RSpec-Expectations

Use this instead of the RSpec ifself in case you just use the specific module gem
'rspec-expectations' to test webpart(s).

Include `shoulda-matchers-cucumber` in your Gemfile:

``` ruby
group :test do
   gem 'shoulda-matchers-cucumber'
end
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install shoulda-matchers-cucumber

Now you can use matchers in your tests as for Cucumber without picking-up the whole RSpec suite.

## Configuring
Then, configure the gem to integrate with RSpec specifying the test framework as `:cucumber`:

``` ruby
Shoulda::Matchers.configure do |config|
   config.integrate do |with|
      with.test_framework :cucumber
      # ...
   end
end
```

## Usage

Write your cucumer rules as usual:

```cucumber
Feature: User model

Scenario: Valid model of User
   Given default User model
   Then the model is valid
```

Then write its steps using shoulda matchers' syntax:

```ruby
Given("default User model") do
   User.create(name: "Vasja")
end

Then("the model is valid") do
   expect(User.first).to validate_presence_of(:name)
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
